## About Me

I solve the craft-scale paradox: how do you maintain human judgment in content while enabling enterprise-scale automation? For 17+ years, I've built content systems and AI governance frameworks that let organizations produce 10x more content in half the time without losing quality or compliance.

I grew up understanding that success isn't about being brilliant—it's about executing fundamentals consistently. That's why I call my consultancy "Good at Bingo": listening, pattern recognition, focused attention, clear communication. These aren't sexy, but they work.

**Current context:** I'm Group Manager of Global Content Strategy at Avanade (Microsoft/Accenture joint venture), where I've built multi-LLM governance frameworks that accelerated $12M in pipeline and reduced content production time by 60%+ across regulated industries.

**Personal stuff:** I think in systems. I believe infrastructure work is more valuable than the AI tools themselves. My portfolio spans wildly different audiences—from Big History Project educational content to Pokémon to Toyota to Target—because designing for constraint forces clarity. When I get excited about a problem, I build frameworks. You'll know I'm really engaged when I start drawing diagrams.

## What I Do (And Why It Matters)

I build the foundational infrastructure that makes AI content systems possible. Most organizations jump to "let's use AI!" before solving the actual problem: their content is inconsistent, ungoverned, and impossible to scale because humans don't have the frameworks to make good decisions.

**My specialty is the unsexy foundation work:**
- Taxonomy and metadata architecture that AI can actually use
- Governance frameworks that accelerate production instead of blocking it
- Multi-LLM routing logic (which model for which task, optimizing cost + quality)
- Change management that turns resistors into governance partners

**Measurable outcomes I've delivered:**
- $12M pipeline acceleration through content velocity improvements
- 60%+ reduction in content production time across Fortune 500 clients
- Engagement increases of 200%+ on major brand refreshes
- Regulatory compliance frameworks in financial services and healthcare

**Where I add unique value:** I've worked across Gates Ventures, Pokémon, Toyota, Target, Amazon, Adobe, and enterprise tech. I design for wildly different audiences simultaneously, which forces a level of systematic thinking most content strategists never develop.

## My Approach to Content Strategy

**Content infrastructure is a strategic asset, not overhead.** Most organizations treat content like a renewable resource—just hire more writers. But scaling without infrastructure creates chaos. I start by understanding how people actually work, not how processes are supposed to work.

**Core beliefs:**
- **Rules vs. Vibes:** Effective AI governance requires distinguishing measurable criteria ("rules") from subjective qualities ("vibes"). Most content failures come from treating vibes as rules or vice versa.
- **Distributed coherence beats single source of truth:** In complex organizations, trying to centralize everything creates bottlenecks. Better to enable good decisions everywhere through shared frameworks.
- **Ask better questions > have better answers:** Though this is rarely rewarded in corporate structures, shifting the question usually matters more than optimizing the answer.
- **Foundation work > shiny tools:** Proper taxonomy, metadata, and governance often deliver more value than the AI tools themselves.

**How I work with stakeholders:**
- I translate technical concepts for non-technical audiences (and vice versa)
- I identify the real problem beneath the surface issue
- I build frameworks that reduce friction, not create it
- I measure meaningful metrics, not vanity metrics
- I default to "show, don't tell"—working prototypes beat theoretical debates

## My Approach to AI Governance

**The biggest blocker isn't technology—it's change management.** Every AI content project I've led has faced the same resistance: "Will this replace my job?" "How do we maintain quality?" "Who's accountable when AI makes a mistake?"

**My change management approach:**
1. **Reframe roles as elevation, not elimination:** Content creators become content strategists. Editors become quality architects. The work gets more interesting, not obsolete.
2. **Turn resistors into governance partners:** The people most skeptical of AI often have the sharpest instincts about quality. Put them on the AI Content Council.
3. **Use risk-based tiering:** Not all content needs the same governance. Routine content (blog posts) can be fast and AI-assisted. High-stakes content (regulatory disclosures) stays human-driven with AI support. This lets teams move fast on 80% of content while maintaining rigor on the 20% that matters most.
4. **Make governance accelerate, not block:** Most approval processes exist because we don't trust the inputs. Fix the inputs (better prompts, better training data, clearer criteria) and you can reduce review cycles.

**My three-tier content model:**
- **Routine:** AI-generated with automated quality checks, human spot-review
- **Standard:** AI-assisted with human editing, standard review process
- **High-stakes:** Human-led with AI support, enhanced review + legal/compliance sign-off

**Multi-LLM routing logic:** Different models for different tasks. Claude for strategic thinking and nuance. GPT-4 for consistency at scale. Specialized models for technical documentation. This optimizes cost while maintaining quality—and creates accountability through model selection as a documented decision.

## My Working Style

**Energy patterns:** I'm most creative in the morning. I do my best systems thinking before noon. Afternoons are for execution, collaboration, and meetings that need less cognitive load.

**Collaboration preferences:**
- I love whiteboarding (physical or Miro). It's how I think through complex problems.
- I default to async communication for efficiency, but sync for alignment on complex topics.
- I'll often reframe or rephrase things to ensure shared understanding—this isn't questioning you, it's ensuring we're solving the same problem.
- I ask "why" a lot. Not to challenge authority, but to understand constraints and surface assumptions.

**Tools I use:** Claude (Sonnet), ChatGPT, Gemini, Runway, Midjourney, Notion, Framer, Canva, Adobe Experience Manager. I'm platform-agnostic but opinionated about workflows.

**My strengths:** Pattern recognition. System design. Translating between technical and non-technical audiences. Identifying problems before they become crises. Building frameworks that scale.

**My gaps:** I get bored with details once the framework is established. I need implementers who love execution. I can get impatient when people confuse motion with progress. I sometimes assume others see patterns as quickly as I do (they don't—I need to slow down and explain).

**In times of stress:** I become more direct. I focus intensely on the problem. I can lose patience with process theater. If I seem abrupt, flag it—I'll adjust.

## Operating Principles

These are my version of "Good at Bingo"—the fundamentals that matter more than brilliance:

1. **Most disagreements are misalignments, not conflicts:** Drive to clarity. Ask why. Assume good intent until proven otherwise.

2. **The person closest to the problem should make the decision:** But they need context, frameworks, and air cover from leadership. My job is providing those, not making every call.

3. **Infrastructure before innovation:** Shiny new tools are worthless without the foundation to use them well. I'd rather build solid taxonomy than chase the latest AI model.

4. **Governance should accelerate, not block:** If your approval process is the bottleneck, you've designed bad governance. Fix the inputs, reduce the reviews.

5. **Show, don't tell:** Working prototypes beat theoretical debates. I'd rather build a rough version and iterate than argue about the perfect approach.

6. **One size doesn't fit all:** I'm rarely dogmatic about process. If something isn't working, we change it. Principles matter; tactics are negotiable.

7. **Trust first, verify through execution:** I assume competence and good intent until proven otherwise. But trust without accountability isn't trust—it's negligence.

8. **Asking better questions > having better answers:** This is my contrarian take. Most organizations reward people who have the answer. I think the person who changes the question adds more value.

9. **Content is a system, not a deliverable:** Every piece of content exists in relationship to other content. Optimizing individual assets while ignoring the system is local optimization that destroys global value.

10. **Respect the craft, enable the scale:** This is the central tension in my work. We can't sacrifice judgment for speed, but we also can't let craftsmanship become an excuse for bottlenecks.

## Communication

**Slack/Teams:** My primary channel for day-to-day work. I default to public channels unless the topic is sensitive/personal. I believe private conversations reduce transparency and create knowledge silos. I'll respond within a few hours during work hours.

**Email:** For formal communications, stakeholder updates, or anything that needs a paper trail. I check twice daily (morning/afternoon).

**Meetings:** I prefer morning meetings for creative/strategic work. Afternoons for execution-focused or lower-cognitive-load discussions. I'm good with video-off for routine stuff, video-on for important alignment.

**Documentation:** I love long-form narrative documents (like this) and visual frameworks. I think in diagrams. Good documentation tells a story and earns the reader's time. I maintain a Notion workspace for everything and sync selectively to Framer for public portfolio work.

**Feedback:** I appreciate direct feedback. If I'm missing something or approaching a problem wrong, tell me. I'd rather know now than discover it later. Same in reverse—if I have feedback for you, I'll be direct but not unkind. My goal is always to help, never to hurt.

**Response expectations:** I'm async-first for most communication. If something is urgent, flag it explicitly. I context-switch a lot (occupational hazard of systems thinking), so I drop messages as I think of them—don't read urgency into response speed.

## How to Work With Me

**If you're a hiring manager:** I'm looking for roles where AI governance and content infrastructure are strategic priorities, not nice-to-haves. I thrive in regulated industries (financial services, healthcare, enterprise) where the stakes are high and the problems are complex. I need autonomy to build frameworks but alignment on outcomes.

**If you're a future colleague:** I'll trust your expertise and expect you to trust mine. I ask questions to understand, not to challenge. I share context constantly because I believe informed teams make better decisions. I'll push you to think systematically, but I'll also back your calls once we're aligned.

**If you're a potential client:** I'm not interested in one-off content projects. I solve systemic problems: governance that doesn't exist, content that doesn't scale, teams that can't adopt AI because their foundation is broken. If you need strategic transformation with measurable ROI, we should talk. If you need execution only, I'll help you find someone better suited.

**The "Good at Bingo" Philosophy in Practice:**

Success isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about consistently executing fundamentals: listening to understand the real problem, recognizing patterns others miss, focusing attention where it matters most, and communicating so clearly that action becomes obvious.

That's what I do. That's how I work. That's the value I bring.

Let's talk if you're solving problems that matter.
